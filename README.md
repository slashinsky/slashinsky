### 👋 Hi, I’m Sarah

I’m a product designer & illustrator based in Atlanta, GA. I am interested in accessibility, data viz, and learning through doing. Aside from work, I love to ride my bike. I am a passionate transit advocate, a [map lover](https://slashinsky.github.io/) and a curious soul.

Like every good designer, I have a [portfolio](https://sarahlashinsky.com/) that "needs updating"!
