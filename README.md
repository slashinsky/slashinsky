### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sarah

Iâ€™m a product designer & illustrator based in Atlanta, GA. I am interested in accessibility, data viz, and learning through doing. Aside from work, I love to ride my bike. I am a passionate transit advocate, a [map lover](https://sarahlashinsky.com/storymap/) and a curious soul.

I hand-coded my [portfolio](https://sarahlashinsky.com/) with the help of Notion for my case studies!.
